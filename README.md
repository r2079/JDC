# JuniperDC


These
 are some of the labs with initial and final configurations which are simulated during a concept / learning prep. 
I absolutely take no responsibility if you intend to use these for any other use-cases or if these break any of the production environments, use
these only for learning Datacenter education. 

I do not havea any Juniper workbooks that i can share with you guys or any images, all the information is available on juniper.net website
for Vsrx trails and Vmx trial case scenarios.


Tools - I have used EVE-NG instead of vagrant so that many people are using EVE-ng. The supplied topology is only a skeleton, you need to have 
	junos image or an srx image to suppor the configurations supplied.

I shall be adding more labs as i complete them along, please feel free to suggest and update and add to these labs, so that these are 
intended to help other members. And strictly, do not request or add any information proprietery to Juniper Networks or its Educational Services


Lab1 - IBGP_ADD_PATH lab.
