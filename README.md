# JuniperDC


These
 are some of the labs with initial and final configurations which are simulated during a concept / learning prep. 
I absolutely take no responsibility if you intend to use these for any other use-cases or if these break any of the production environments, use
these only for learning Datacenter education. 

I do not havea any Juniper workbooks that i can share with you guys or any images, all the information is available on juniper.net website
for Vsrx trails and Vmx trial case scenarios.


Tools - I have used EVE-NG instead of vagrant so that many people are using EVE-ng. The supplied topology is only a skeleton, you need to have 
	junos image or an srx image to suppor the configurations supplied.

Lab1 - IBGP_ADD_PATH lab.
